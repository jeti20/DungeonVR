xx.09.2023
- Added level holder
- Added movement
- Added animations for interactions when player step it, and spike pops out and kill the player. Player have to throw brick on them to activate them and run away from them
- Some enemy with breakable walls

Strugles:
- I do not understand why my XR Origin is in random position instead of the position of 0,0,0.
